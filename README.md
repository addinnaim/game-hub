GameHub is a video game discovery web app that helps users find games to play. 

To view app go to right corner of repository at About and click the link. 

# Getting Started

To get started with GameHub, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to local machine.
2. Run npm install to install the required dependencies.
3. Get a RAWG API key at https://rawg.io/apidocs. Need to create an account first.
4. Add the API key to src/services/api-client.ts.
5. Run npm run dev to start the web server.


*This is an example project written in Typescript for discovering video games. A mini version of a website called rawg.io. 
Sill havenâ€™t finish implementing routing using react router. For global state management, am planning to use Zustand instead of Redux. 
Will finish up soon.
